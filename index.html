        <p>For ISM220 course, me and my team members have developed an application to help DePaul students involved in the sale and purchase of school materials.</p>
        
        <p>We noticed that students are required to purchase textbooks and School materials every quarter. However, once they are done using, they do not use them anymore. For these reasons, we thought it would be great if there is an app that can connect students so they can sell or buy textbooks and school materials from each other. By doing that, they can purchase required school items with cheaper prices, and they can also get rid of their items and earn money by selling them. </p>
        
        <p>We used double diamond methods to create prototype. We gathered information (divergent), analyzed (convergent), brainstormed (divergent), and created prototype (convergent).</p>

            <h2> Research</h2>
            <p>Through interviews and competitive analysis, we investigated how DePaul students purchased and processed second-hand school items. Using affinity diagrams, we sorted and grouped the data and gave a title for each group. </p>
        <P>Data analysis was the biggest challenge. We didn't know exactly how affinity diagram should work, so it took a long time to sort the data. </P>

            <h2> Analysis</h2>
        <p>With this activity, we were able to find students most considerable elements (<strong>Insights</strong>) <br>
            - Convenience is a major factor in student purchasing materials<br>
            - Students want to receive materials on time<br>
            - Students prefer to use the simplest process when getting textbooks<br>
            - Students want different options when buying textbooks<br>
            - Students prefer to receive higher quality textbooks<br>
            - Many students consider price the most when getting textbooks<br>
            - Students don’t want to pay more than they have to<br>
            - A lot of students have textbooks and materials sitting around<br>
            - Students want to get rid of their old materials<br>
            - Students want to have the exact materials required <br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>With these insights we came up with Design Principles<br>
            - A successful solution will get students the exact quality and variation they need<br>
            - A successful solution will allow students to get rid of all materials<br>
            - A successful solution will encourage affordability<br>
            - A successful solution will get students their materials on time for their assignments<br>
            - A successful solution will provide convenience to student<br>

            <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
        <p>We brainstormed the concept that can be fulfilled our design principles. <br>
            Belows are our six best concepts<br>
            - Search  - filters, price, and comparison<br>
            - Sellers - pictures, title, author, ISBN, description (for materials)<br>
            - Seller + buyer ratings / profiles<br>
            - Buying process - buy / rent / shipping through delivery or in-person meet-up<br>
            - Syllabus feature<br>
            - Calendar - when the book will get to you / tracking / when you need the book soon<br>
            </p>
        <p>We created Storyboards and Interface Sketches that briefly depict our concepts. </p>

        <div class="paragraphs"> 
            <p>We came up with user stories that show users’ needs.<br>
            - As a student, I need to be able to find the exact materials for my classes so that I can be on top of my assignments.<br>
            - As a student, I want to be able to post material listings so that I can sell my used materials.<br>
            - As a student, I want to see the cheapest options for school supplies so that I can save money.<br>
            - As a student, I want to quickly receive material so that I can have it on time for assignments. <br>
            - As a student, I want an easy process to purchase materials from my phone so that I can buy materials on the go.<br>
            - As a student, I want to know who I’m purchasing from so that I know everything is legitimate.<br>
            </p>
            <p>We determined to create an application that connects students to students and allow them to share, sell, and purchase school items.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        <p>With low-fidelity and mid-fidelity prototype activity, we refined our hidi-fidelity prototype.  <br> <br>
            <Strong>Design Goals</Strong> <br>
            We were trying to create an app that is  <br>
            - easy to navigate <br>
            - visually simple  <br>
            - functionally working <br>

        <p><Strong>High-Fidelity Prototype</Strong></p>
        <p>Using Axure, we created a hi-fidelity prototype. We structure the site map of the application. The, we created wireframes for each screen. We tried to integrate all the screens into one theme. We focused on unifying color, buttons, and alignments. We also tried to add functions that prevent from an error and give user control and freedom.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>With this project, I was able to learn how to use and analyze data using affinity diagram, earn concrete idea and usage of prototype. Now, I can confidently say I am comfortable with creating mid and high-fidelity prototypes using axure. It provided me a great opportunity to experiment design patterns into the application. It was actually a little bit tough project but I definitely obtained a lot from. I learned the font-size, box shapes, color theme, and alignment complement visual completion while functionality was also a crucial part of the prototype. Now, I can say that I know the complete process of prototyping from research.</p>
